This automation folder is for 4 instances provided by this project.
1 command is needed to setup everything in Nectar.
command:
. terminal.sh
(since new instances need some time for OS initialization, so after executing boto, wait around 10 miniutes
then execute ansible, each yaml is separated by 1 minute interval, this is a buffer time to wait everything
runs normally)
