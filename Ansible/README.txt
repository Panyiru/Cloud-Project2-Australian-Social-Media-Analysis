Demo Code folder is the source code for the demo video(the setup process of two private instances)

Automation folder is the source code for the team project, since all 4 instances are running and processing
data, we cannot delete them and create them again to demonstrate whole setup process. The setup logic is
same as the Demo Code, so please refer the Demo Code and video, two instances can demonstrate the whole process
from create instances by boto, and install dependencies, setup CouchDB, replicator and execute harvester.
